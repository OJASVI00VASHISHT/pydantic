    "In simple terms, a TypedDict is a way to create a template for a Python dictionary. It lets you define what keys should be in a dictionary and what type of value each key should hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a contract or a checklist for a dictionary. For example, if you're working with data about a person, you can define a TypedDict to ensure that every \"person\" dictionary has a name (which must be a string) and an age (which must be an integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a powerful tool for static type checkers (like mypy), which can then check your code for errors. If you try to add a key that's not on your checklist or assign a value of the wrong type, the checker will flag an error, helping you catch bugs before you even run your program. At runtime, a TypedDict is just a normal dictionary."
